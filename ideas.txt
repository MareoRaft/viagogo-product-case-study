Try a combination of location and popularity.

Use user data to get a more specific idea of what is popular for THEM.  Maybe based on age.

Consider making the height of the panes smaller so that more of them appear on the screen.

Look at previous purchases of an event among people of that location to see what they are buying.

Consider the number of tickets you need to sell.  It makes no sense to advertise a very popular event if the tickets are already sold out.
